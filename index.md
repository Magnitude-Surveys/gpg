Magnitude Surveys - Introduction to Geophysics
=======================================

This is remixed and derived from Geophysics for Practising
Geoscientisits by GeoSci Developers, Douglas W. Oldenburg and Francis
H.M. Jones.

The GPG is a learning resource for applied geophysics and its
applications to help solve problems of relevance to society including
those in resource exploration, environmental applications, and
geotechnical projects.

Geophysical surveys and data are sensitive to physical property
variations in the subsurface. These variations can be diagnostic for
finding resources, tracking contamination or mapping geologic units.

Application of a geophysical technique to help answer a geoscientific
question requires that targeted physical properties be identified and
appropriate geophysical surveys, processing and interpretation be
carried out.

The application of geophysics is consolidated into a Seven Step
procedure that serves as a guiding template in every problem. In the GPG
we discuss the physical principles for each type of survey and carry
through with applications. The focus is on environmental, resource
exploration and geotechnical problems but the concepts span a broad
range of applications. The GPG is meant to be a resource for
geoscientists, including those who are not specialists in geophysics, in
particular geological engineers, geologists, and undergraduate
geophysicists. The GPG is light on mathematical development but links to
deeper levels of analysis are provided.

To ease readers' understanding in applied geophysics and its
applocations, materials in GPG are integrated with the Jupyter apps. We
strongly promote readers to use both text materials in GPG and apps
together. By clicking below **binder** badge will show you list of the
apps, and there you can run the app.

Development of the GPG is ongoing, with the core development team
consisting of researchers and students at the University of British
Columbia. We welcome input and collaborators! Join the development on
