Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is an electromagnetic method used for
very near surface exploration; metres through 10s of metres. It is
sometimes referred to as echo-sounding. GPR exploits contrasts in
electromagnetic properties in order to define the physical boundaries of
shallow structures (both natural and man-made). Physical properties
important to GPR include: `physical_properties_dielectric_permittivity`,
`physical_properties_conductivity` and
`Magnetic Permeability <physprop_mag_susc>`. Ground penetrating radar is
used for a variety of applications. These include:

> -   Investigating concrete structures and roads
> -   Mapping the thickness of peat-bogs and other sedimentary layers
> -   Obtaining the depth to groundwater or permafrost
> -   Locating buried infrastructure such as irrigation pipes, tunnels
>     and electrical wires
> -   Finding land mines and unexploded ordnance

During GPR surveys, a source (*T**x*) is used to send a pulse of
high-frequency electromagnetic waves (radiowaves) into the ground. As
the radiowaves propagate through the Earth, they are distorted as a
result of the Earth's electromagnetic properties. At boundaries where
the subsurface electromagnetic properties change abruptly, radiowave
signals may undergo transmission, reflection and/or refraction. Because
of this, much of the understanding of seismic methods can be applied to
ground penetrating radar.

Sensors (*R**x*) at the Earth's surface measure the amplitudes and
travel times of signals returning to the surface. These data from each
trace (Tx-Rx pair) are amalgamated and represented using a radargram
(similar to a seismogram). The horizontal axis (distance) is used to
represent the location of the receiver relative to the source for a
particular sounding. The vertical axis shows the travel times of
measured signal. By assuming some a-priori knowledge of the radiowave
velocity, the vertical axis is sometimes represented by an approximate
travel distance. The gray-scale denotes the amplitude of the returning
signal at each time and location. It is from radargrams that we will do
the majority of our interpretation of GPR data.
