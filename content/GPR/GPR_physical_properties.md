# Physical Properties

Unlike the survey methods discussed previously, signals corresponding to
ground penetrating radar (GPR) depend on a multitude of physical
properties. The most important physical property to GPR is the
`dielectric permittivity <physical_properties_dielectric_permittivity>`
($`\varepsilon`$), as it greatly influences the velocity, attenuation,
reflection, refraction and transmission of radiowaves. These concepts
will be presented in the following section. Dielectric permittivity is
considered the diagnostic physical property for GPR. In addition to the
dielectric permittivity, the propagation of radiowaves through the Earth
may depend significantly on the
`electrical conductivity<physical_properties_conductivity>`
($`\sigma`$); provided the electrical conductivity of the Earth is
sufficiently large. Radiowaves will also reflect off of very conductive
objects buried in the Earth. If the Earth is magnetic, we may also need
to consider the role of `magnetic permeability<physprop_mag_susc>`
($`\mu`$).

## Example: Microwaves

In order to better understand the link between the dielectric
permittivity ($`\varepsilon`$) and electromagnetic waves, let us
consider a microwave oven. We know that microwaves heat food using
electromagnetic radiation, but how do they work?

Within a microwave oven, there is a source which generates
high-frequency electromagnetic waves (f = 2.45 GHz). These waves move at
roughly the speed of light (c = $`3.00 \times 10^8`$ m/s) and have
wavelengths of about 12.2 cm. We can see from the figure on the right,
that EM waves support electric and magnetic fields which oscillate.

The walls within the microwave are made out of materials which reflect
elecromagnetic waves. As a result, the walls designed not to heat up
while the microwave is on.

All foods contain water to varying degrees. Water is unique from most
other molecules because it is naturally polarized (carries an electric
dipole moment). This property of water molecules makes them align with
electric fields very easily; giving them a
`high dielectric permittivity <GPR_table_velocity>` ($`\varepsilon_r`$ =
80). When electromagnetic waves come into contact with the water
molecules in the food, the water molecules physically re-orient with the
oscillation of the wave. This is because of the oscillating electric
field carried by the wave. For waves at 2.45 GHz, this is occurring over
2 billion times per second!

The magic of microwaves is their operating frequency. At roughly 2.45
GHz, water molecules absorb the energy from electromagnetic waves and
become agitated. The heat energy generated by the physical movement of
the water molecules is then transferred throughout the food. Therefore,
microwaves work by heating water molecules with electromagnetic
radiation.

What about the turntable or glass of the microwave? The glass and
plastic which make up the window and turntable of the microwave have low
dielectric permittivities. As a result, these materials do not become
polarized by the incoming microwaves, making them non-reactive.

So what have we learned from this example?

> - Very conductive materials will reflect incoming electromagnetic
>   waves.
> - Materials containing water will become polarized from
>   electromagnetic waves.
> - Some materials do not absorb electromagnetic radiation easily.
> - The operating frequency of the source has a great impact on the
>   response of materials.
