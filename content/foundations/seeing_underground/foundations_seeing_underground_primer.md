Geophysical surveys are performed when information about the earth's
subsurface is desired, but direct sampling through expensive and
invasive techniques such as drilling or trenching is insufficient,
impractical or ill-advised. A survey may be as large as the whole Earth,
as small as the top few meters of the subsurface, or anywhere in
between.

## Measuring physical properties

During a geophysical survey, energy is put into the earth and responses
are recorded at the surface, in the air or in boreholes. Resulting data
reveal information about the earth because the behavior of the energy
within the ground is controlled by the distribution of the earth's
physical properties. For instance, one basic physical property is
magnetic susceptibility, which describes a rock's ability to become
magnetized. This physical property provides information on rock type and
structures because the rock's magnetic susceptibility relates directly
to mineral type and the chemical alteration processes. A second
important physical property is electrical conductivity, which quantifies
a material's ability to carry electrical current. Figure 2 illustrates
one way a geophysical survey can be carried out to provide information
about the subsurface distribution of electrical conductivity.

Evidently, the application of geophysics to problems involving earth's
subsurface is a non-trivial process and should be conducted through the
seven-step procedure.

## Traditional interpretation

Traditionally, useful information was extracted from geophysical field
results by examining maps or line profiles of raw or filtered survey
data. Such images are useful for estimating locations and quantities of
buried materials and to help choose locations for more invasive (and
expensive) techniques such as drilling. For example, large-scale maps of
magnetic or gravity data often show the geologic structure or identify
an anomalous region that might be associated with a desired target. As
an example, Figure 3 shows the magnetic data acquired at the Bathurst
region of New Brunswick. The major features observed are related to
geologic structure.

Historically, in mineral exploration, the identification of an anomalous
region was often the endpoint of the analysis, and the image was used to
plan the location of a drill hole. Unfortunately, the success rate was
generally poor. At best, data maps provide some information about the
lateral extent of a body but little information about what is happening
at depth. Quantitative analysis, in particular inversion, is required to
obtain 3D information.

## Inversion

> </figure>

The goal of the inverse problem is to find a mathematical model of the
earth that produced the field observations. That is, "What subsurface
physical property distribution caused the data observed at the surface?"
Earlier inversion solutions involved characterizing the earth by a few
prisms or layers and finding geometrical and physical properties of
these simplified earth models.

Due to the earth's extreme complexity, useful models often need many
parameters, usually more than the number of data. This means that the
problem of finding a model (i.e. estimating values for every parameter)
is one in which there are more unknowns than data. Such problems do not
have unique solutions, and this nonuniqueness is exacerbated when data
are noisy or inaccurate. Formal inversion methods address these issues
using well-defined mathematical techniques. An appendix explains
inversion in a little more detail.

Some benefits of applying rigorous inversion can be seen by comparing
traditional map and pseudosection plots of the raw data to the
information in 3D and 2D models obtained by inversion.
