In a geophysical survey, energy is put into the ground and responses are
measured. The responses depend upon the physical properties in the
ground and the survey itself. The geophysical data can be used to
generate images that convey geologic information and they can be further
processed to yield information about the distribution of the physical
property. Geophysics is, therefore, useful if the connection between the
geologic or engineering problem and the physical property is known. In
this section, we introduce some fundamental concepts and definitions
about geophysical surveys, physical properties, terminology and provide
examples that illustrate how geophysics can be used.
