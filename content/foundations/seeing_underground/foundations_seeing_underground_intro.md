# Introduction

## Importance of Earth's subsurface

The surface of the earth has provided the setting for most human
endeavors throughout the history of civilization, and these activities
have been profoundly affected by the largely invisible characteristics
of the immediate subsurface. Human development has depended heavily on
resources obtained from both near surface (as in construction materials)
and from hundreds to thousands of meters deep (as in metalliferous ores
and petroleum based products). We also use water from subsurface
aquifers, deposit much of our waste within the near subsurface, and
build structures that must interface safely with these shallow regions.

## Physical properties vs rock type and structure

In relation to these activities, subsurface characteristics of
particular interest to earth scientists include the location,
distribution and structure of rock types, grain size distribution,
material strength, porosity and permeability and others. The earth's
inherent complexity can make it difficult or impossible to infer these
characteristics from direct observation. Therefore, they often must be
inferred from the distribution of more fundamental physical properties
such as density, electrical conductivity, acoustic impedance and others.
These basic properties can be measured via geophysical surveys that
record the earth's response to various types of natural or humanmade
signals. The following table lists physical properties that are most
commonly related to geological materials and/or structures, and
geophysical survey types that can map variations of these physical
properties.

Other physical properties that can be usefully mapped include
chargeability, natural radioactivity, dielectric permitivity, and
porosity.

## Demand for improved modeling

Subsurface structures are usually interpreted either in terms of
objects, layers, linear features, or complex distributions. This type of
information, obtained remotely and non-invasively using geophysical
surveys, is routinely used in geotechnical, exploration and
environmental activities to characterize geological structures, estimate
ore reserves, map contaminant plumes, etc. What is involved in obtaining
such information? First, fieldwork is done (Figure 1), which involves
making many careful measurements along survey lines on the ground or
from aircraft. Traditionally, interpretations of these measurements are
often made from graphs or maps of raw or processed data, resulting in
qualitative or crudely quantitative information about the locations,
depths, and types of materials underground.

In the face of ongoing demand for increasingly quantitative information,
however, sophisticated techniques are now being used to numerically
estimate the distribution of the earth's physical properties. These
modelling procedures give geoscientists a more cost-effective, reliable
and accurate means of extracting as much information as possible from
conventional survey data. They also make it possible to present the
rather technical information in more visual and meaningful ways to
managers, shareholders, regulatory agencies and other interest groups.

After reading this section, it should become evident that the
application of geophysics to problems involving earth's subsurface is a
non-trivial process. A seven-step framework should be used to help
understand each aspect of this process. This framework can be viewed in
`../foundations_sevensteps`.
