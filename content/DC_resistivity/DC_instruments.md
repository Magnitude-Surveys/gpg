# DC resistivity instruments

## Transmitters

High power and reliable constant current are the primary requirements.
For small scale work, transmitters capable of sourcing up to several
hundred milliwatts of power might be adequate. For larger scale work, it
is possible to obtain transmitters that can source up to 30,000 watts.
Current is usually injected as a 50% duty cycle reversing square wave;
that is, current is on for several seconds, off for several seconds, on
with reversed polarity, off, etc.

Decay voltages in IP surveys (measured during a time domain
transmitter's "off" stages) are often two orders of magnitude smaller
than primary voltages. Therefore, very high-power transmitters are often
desirable. For mineral exploration in conductive ground (where
potentials will be small), it is possible to obtain transmitters capable
of sourcing tens of kilowatts of power. Needless to say, these are
rather dangerous systems, and definitely not portable! The figures below
show several currently available transmitters.

## Receivers

For DC resistivity sounding, a simple digital volt meter can be
adequate. A more complex system may involve amplifiers, filters,
transmitter synchronizing circuits, display, storage, many inputs for
simultaneous recording of many potentials, and other features.
Synchronization with the transmitter is essential if IP data are to be
gathered, but it is not critical if resistivity information only is to
be obtained. IP receivers also must be capable of recording several
signal strengths covering several orders of magnitude because signals
while the transmitter is on may be several volts, while decay voltages
during the transmitter's "off" time may be only a few micro or
millivolts.

## Electrodes

In general, current injection and potential measurement electrodes are
not interchangeable. However, automated acquisition systems using
smaller source currents do employ the same stainless steel electrodes,
both for sourcing current and measuring potentials. This becomes more
and more difficult as source currents increase because the ground can
become altered by high current densities.

For injecting current, low impedance is required, i.e. good contact
resistance is the primary concern. Stainless steel stakes, sheets of
foil, wetted (and perhaps salted) ground, are all possible approaches to
improving contact resistance.

For measuring potentials, low noise, non-polarizing (not necessarily low
impedance) electrodes are the primary concern. Small lead plates buried
in the soil will often do the trick. In more difficult situations, wet
electrodes made from porous ceramic jars containing copper sulfate
solution are required. See Corwin, 1990 for a good discussion of
electrodes for this type of galvanic work.

## Cables

-   For small scale work, some systems are available that use
    multiconductor cable, and possibly "smart" electrodes that can be
    switched between input and measurement functions by computer.
-   For large scale work, this is not practical because of the large
    currents involved (up to a hundred Amps or so in some cases).
    Multiconductor cables with individual wires capable of carrying that
    current would be prohibitively heavy for mineral exploration
    surveys, which commonly involve profile lines several kilometers
    long.
-   However, there are some systems that use multiconductor seismic
    cable for the potentials while requiring the normal single, heavy
    gauge wire for the current source.

## Variations on the theme

Since the early 1990's manufacturers of instruments have been producing
automated systems which permit the use of electrodes for either current
source or potential measurements. Some systems involve planting a series
of electrodes and wiring them together with a cable, which allows each
electrode to be selected either as a potential electrode or as a current
source. This procedure is being implemented in borehole projects, as
well as surface surveys. Examples of systems that work in this manner
are given in the following list (as of January 2007).

Another arrangement involves a towed array system in which all potential
and source electrodes are basically heavy metallic weights. This
arrangement is efficient when the survey site is essentially flat and
ground is relatively soft. Other similar systems used both for land and
marine use use capacitively coupled electrodes rather than electrodes
that make galvanic (direct) contact with earth materials. One example of
this approach can be seen at at the
[Geometrics](http://www.geometrics.com/) (image to the right) website
(as of January 2007), and others.

In the early 1990's receivers were developed that could record complete
digitized potential waveforms rather than simply measuring voltages at
specific times relative to the transmitted signal. These systems produce
large data sets, but with field computers running the systems, storage
is not a problem. Fully digitized waveforms have several potential
advantages, including identification and removal of all types of noise,
and interpretation of subtle, 2nd and 3rd order effects caused by
frequency dependent responses of subsurface materials. One example of a
current full waveform system is the Titan 24 Deep Earth Imaging System
of Quantec Geoscience (as of January 2007). An example of full waveform
data gathered by MIDAAS Inc. in the early 1990's is shown to the right.
The figure shows the "off-time" IP signals for 12 potential measurements
taken using one current station. "On-time" signals are not shown.
