# Anisotropic ground

Structural anisotropy (for example, layering or fracturing) causes the
simple form of Ohm's law to break down because current flow is not
necessarily parallel to the forcing electric field. Instead of simply
writing *J* = *σ**E* = −*σ**Δ**V*, we have to write

$$J_i = -\sigma\_{ik} \frac{\partial V}{\partial  x_k} \quad i,k = 1,2,3$$

In homogeneous ground with a single current and potential electrodes,
the expression for *V* (voltage) in terms of resistivity and distance
from the current source is *V* = −*I**ρ*/2*π**r* (which was shown
above). In anisotropic ground, there are different values of resistivity
for the horizontal and a vertical directions. The expression for voltage
in terms of the two resistivities and distance is

$$V=-I \frac{\sqrt{\rho_h \rho_v}}{2 \pi r} = - \frac{I \rho_h \lambda}{2 \pi r}$$

where *λ* = (*ρ*<sub>*i*</sub>/*ρ*<sub>*h*</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup> is
called the coefficient of anisotropy. See the table below for some
values of *λ* encountered in common geological materials.
