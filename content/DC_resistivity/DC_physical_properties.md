# Conductivity

As part of the electromagnetics methods, DC resistivity is sensitive to
`electrical conductivity<physical_properties_conductivity>` *σ*
(Siemens/meter). We sometimes work with the inverse of conductivity
which is electrical resistivity *ρ* which has units *Ω**m* (ohm-meters).
Electrical conductivity is a bulk property of material that
characterizes the ease that current flows through the material when an
electrical force is applied. Electric current (units of Amperes)
quantifies the amount of charge that is moving by an observer in one
second.

The electrical conductivity of Earth's materials varies over many orders
of magnitude. It depends upon many factors, including: rock type,
porosity, connectivity of pores, nature of the fluid, and metallic
content of the solid matrix. A very rough indication of the range of
conductivity for rocks and minerals is presented in `Resistivity Table`.

Soils and rocks are composed mostly of silicate minerals, which are
essentially insulators. Exceptions include magnetite, specular hematite,
carbon, graphite, pyrite, and pyrrhotite. Therefore conduction is
largely electrolytic, so conductivity depends mainly upon:

> -   porosity;
> -   hydraulic permeability, which describes how pores are
>     interconnected;
> -   moisture content;
> -   concentration of dissolved electrolytes;
> -   temperature and phase of pore fluid;
> -   amount and composition of colloids (clay content).
