# Conductivity

Electromagnetic methods are sensitive principally to `electrical
conductivity<physical_properties_conductivity>` $`\sigma`$
(Siemens/meter). We sometimes work with the inverse of conductivity
which is electrical resistivity $`\rho`$ which has units $`\Omega m`$
(ohm-meters). Electrical conductivity characterizes the ease that
current flows through the material when an electrical force is applied.
Electric current (units of Amperes) quantifies the amount of charge that
is moving by an observer in one second. The electrical conductivity of
Earth's materials varies over many orders of magnitude. It depends upon
many factors, including: rock type, porosity, connectivity of pores,
nature of the fluid, and metallic content of the solid matrix. A very
rough indication of the range of conductivity for rocks and minerals is
presented in `roughchart`.

While conductivity is the generally the main physical property of
interest, EM induction methods also depend on the [magnetic
permeability](http://em.geosci.xyz/content/physical_properties/magnetic_permeability/index.html)
and [electrical
permitivity](http://em.geosci.xyz/content/physical_properties/dielectric_permittivity/index.html)
of rocks. Their importance depends upon the frequency of the EM signal
used for given a system.
