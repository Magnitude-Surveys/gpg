In this section we will study electromagnetic (EM) methods. In applied
geophysics, the term is usually used to refer to methods that use a low
frequency time-varying magnetic field as a source to excite electrical
currents in the ground through the principle of electromagnetic
induction. These methods are sensitive to the electrical conductivity of
the subsurface. The GPR, DC resistivity and induced polarization methods
are also governed by the laws of electromagnetism but excite the earth
differently enough that they are classified separately.
