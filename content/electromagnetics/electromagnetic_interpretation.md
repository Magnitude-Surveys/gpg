</figure>

In this section, we use a real-world example to illustrate the use of
electromagnetic (EM) methods. In this industrial reclamation case study,
the interpretation of EM data had proven useful in characterizing the
sub-surface and answering the following questions:

> 1- What is the thickness of the mixed fill layer (i.e. what is the
> depth to till)?
>
> 2- What is the distribution of buried objects? Many objects are
> thought to exist, possibly ranging in size from small pieces of
> industrial trash, to railway lines, reinforced concrete building
> foundations, and buried tanks.
>
> 3- Can geophysics contribute any information about the extent of
> hydrocarbons within the top layer, which consists of a wide range of
> fill materials?
>
> 4- Where is fill material dominated by wood waste, making ground unfit
> to support structures?

The field site in question is an urban area with a complex industrial
history located on the outskirt of downtown Vancouver, Canada. The same
site had been used for the 1986 **World Exposition on Transportation and
Communication**, also known as the Expo site. Following the Expo, the
city undertook excation work prior to the construction of public space
\[REF NEEDED\]. *The actual field site was fully remediated by the end
of 1991, as summarized by the closure report prepared by Golder
Associates Ltd.*

### Historical Land Use

</figure>

The land had been used by several insdustries over the years, laying
down pipes, railroads, cables and several utility buildings. The history
of industrial activity is fairly complex, and covers over 100 years. For
example, `Expo_excavation` shows some of the wood waste mixed in with
the fill under the pavement at this location. More details about the
history are available through the few engineering documents presented
below:

&#10;                   After 1902 there was a gas manufacturing plant with storage facilities, an oil house, an auto repair garage, and a substation maintenance facility. The gas plant left some quantities of ammonia, phenolics, cyanide, oxides, and light hydrocarbons, as well as other miscellaneous waste. The substation maintenance shop included a sump in the floor into which dielectric fluids from capacitors and transformers was drained. Oil from this  sump was piped to the oil house for treatment and recycling. This oil house included large tanks, at least one of which was underground. There was also the Viaduct traffic overpass crossing over the central portion of our site, and associated support foundations may well have been left in the ground when the viaduct was later removed.<br>

### Stratigraphy

Based on monitoring wells, boreholes and trenching the north-south cross
section shown to the right was constructed. The five primary
stratigraphic units in the area of interest can be described as follows.

<figure class="align-right">
<img src="./images/Expo_Stratigraphy.jpg" id="Expo_Stratigraphy"
alt="./images/Expo_Stratigraphy.jpg" />
<figcaption>Known stratigraphy from monitoring wells, boreholes and
trenching.</figcaption>
</figure>

- The top half metre consisted of two layers of very hard pavement.
- The fill below was very variable, consisting mainly of mineral fill,
  but with considerable quantities of other materials, including buried
  metal and concrete, wood waste, construction debris and gravel fill.
  Individually, these materials have a wide range of physical and
  geotechnical properties, and when used as fill, bulk (averaged)
  properties would also range widely. Identifying elevation highs and
  lows may provide some insight as to where more (or less) compressible
  fill materials existed.
- The next unit below the artificial fill was a sandy silt (or silty
  clay in some areas), ranging between zero and one metre thick. The
  deepest layer penetrated by boreholes was a very dense gray sandy
  silt, with some gravel and traces of clay - basically a till.
- The depth to this till is moderately well-constrained under the
  profile to the west of the field site.
- Sedimentary bedrock was reportedly deeper than 20 m.

### Hydrogeology

The depth to the water table was known to vary between 1 and 3 m, with
flow generally towards the South West. The principle hydrostratigraphic
unit (fill) was generally highly permeable but with isolated regions
that appeared to block flow through this aquifer. Transformer oil
contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) was found in boreholes
and test trenches floating on the water table 2 m to 3 m below ground
surface in some parts of the northern half of the field site.

### Buried Metal and Objects

<figure class="align-right">
<img src="./images/Expo_Buried_Metal.jpg" id="Expo_Buried_Metal"
alt="./images/Expo_Buried_Metal.jpg" />
<figcaption>Buried oil tankIn two of the test pits, high inflows of
water (and some oil) were observed in zones of coarse wood waste
characterized by open voids up to 10 cm in size</figcaption>
</figure>

Many kinds of buried objects were encountered in the fill layer. There
was much buried metal including wires, tanks, and other known and
unknown objects. `Expo_Buried_Metal` shows a buried tank found at test
pit 28. A buried oil sump was also expected in the location of the oil
house associated with the maintenance shop near the North edge of the
site. It is also possible that re-bar reinforced concrete foundations of
buildings or supports for the old traffic Viaduct could be encountered.
There were also old railways, although no evidence of the iron rails
themselves was found in trenches or boreholes. Above ground, there are
several lamps, and a chain link fences surrounds our study area on three
sides. The lamps are expected to be connected to underground wiring
since they are not fed by overhead wires.

### Hydrocarbons

Early in our work, a monitoring well was discovered to have up to 20 cm
of oil floating on the water table, containing concentrations of PCB's
higher than the local special waste regulations permitted. As a result,
an investigation program was conducted to delineate the areal extent and
thickness of the oil, to assess the PCB concentrations, and to locate
any potential remaining sources of oil such as underground tanks. The
investigation involved excavation of 36 test pits, and collection of 7
oil samples, 58 soil samples, and 10 water samples. Details about all
boreholes and test pits are contained in a separate report. We recommend
that geophysical surveys be conducted in order to further delineate
contaminated zones, and to locate subsurface features that might be
associated with oils. This is because the largest concentrations of
PCB's were found in black stained soil inside or adjacent to buried
pipes and transformer parts. This increases the importance of
investigating all geophysical anomalies that could be buried metal
debris.

<figure class="align-right">
<img src="./images/Expo_Hydrocarbon.jpg" id="Expo_Hydrocarbon"
alt="./images/Expo_Hydrocarbon.jpg" />
<figcaption>PCB samples measured at the Expo site.</figcaption>
</figure>

PCB concentrations were measured in 58 soil samples with results as
shown in `Expo_Hydrocarbon`. Most of the contamination was found within
the depth range of 1m to 3m, which corresponds to the fluctuation of the
water table. Samples from five standpipe locations were used to
characterize the oil itself, in terms of carbon distribution, viscosity,
specific gravity and flashpoint. The oil / water contact was found to be
blurred even after samples gathered from standpipes had been left to
stand for 24 hrs. The diffuse layer between oil and water was inferred
to consist of emulsified oil possibly resulting from weathering due to
microbial activity over the extended time period. Note that this
probably has important implications for detection using geophysics for
at least two reasons: i) the interface between water and oil is not
manifested as a distinct transition in physical properties, and ii)
there are in effect three fluids rather than two - water, oil, and the
mixture.

## Survey

The Geonics EM-31 instrument is used to map variations of electrical
conductivity within the top 3 to 6 metres of the sub-surface. This
chapter of our report summarizes survey design and results obtained.
Detailed interpretation was not one of our contractual oblications.
Survey design

For EM-31 surveys, rapid acquisition of spatially dense data sets is
usually the most important requirement. When searching for discrete
targets, the most important design consideration is to avoid spatial
aliassing. For small 3D targets a tightly spaced grid would be required.
For 2D targets (such as buried utility pipes), data spacing along
profile lines would likely be tighter than spacing between lines,
assuming lines can be placed perpendicular to target orientation.

At our field site, EM-31 data were gathered on a 2m grid resulting in
measurements of in-phase and quadrature response at 2600 stations. Since
the instrument response to elongated buried objects depends upon the
orientation of the instrument, two complete data sets were gathered,
with the instrument's 3.66 m boom oriented both in north-sourth and
east-west directions.

Both complete data sets are presented in `Expo_EW_NS`. They were
recorded using the "normal" vertical dipole coil orientation with the
instrument held 1 m above the ground.

Apparent conductivity data are presented in units of milliSeimens per m
(mS/m) using a rainbow colour scale with banding so that values and
local trends are both visible. Corresponding in-phase data are in
percent of primary field strength, and are presented using a bimodal
colour scale since results are generally interpreted qualitatively to
identify buried metal rather than quantitatively in terms of ground
material properties.

## Processing

Since data were gathered using two different instrument orientations, it
is easy to supply averaged and differenced data sets. Averaged and
differential maps are presented in `Expo_Avg_Diff`. The effect of
averaging data from two orientations is to smooth responses, emphasizing
regions where ground is more uniform. The objective of differencing data
from two orientations is to emphasize features that depend upon
instrument orientation. For apparent conductivity data the result is
that linear and small 3D targets are more clearly decerned. Click the
