# Basic Principles

Electromagnetic survey methods are based on two fundamental principles:
Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction and the fact that electric
currents generate magnetic fields, expressed in Ampère's law. In its
simplest form Faraday's law states that the electromotive force (EMF) in
a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux
through the circuit, or in even simpler terms: a changing magnetic field
will induce an EMF.

The magnetic flux *ϕ*<sub>*B*</sub> which crosses a closed loop is given
by

*ϕ*<sub>*B*</sub> = ∫<sub>*a**r**e**a*</sub>*B⃗* ⋅ *n̂* *d**a⃗*

where *n̂* is the outward pointing normal vector for the loop and *B⃗* is
the magnetic flux density, which is proportional to the magnetic field
in free space. This is illustrated in the diagram below

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="./images/IntFaradayDiagram-emf-version.svg"
alt="./images/IntFaradayDiagram-emf-version.svg" />
</figure>

Faraday's law relates the magnetic flux through the surface bordered by
the loop to the induced EMF in the loop

$$V = - \frac{d \phi_B}{dt}.$$

Recall that the current *I* flowing in the wire is related to the EMF
through Ohm's law

*V* = *I**R*,

where *R* is the electrical resistance of the circuit.

We can start to develop an intuition about Faraday's law using the
example of a permanent magnet moving through a coil of wire. The
electric field generated by the moving magnet creates an electric force
on the charges in the wire, causing current to flow. You can explore
this example interactively using the applet below from
[PhET](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/faraday).

We can observe several characteristics of EM induction using the applet:

1.  The voltmeter only registers a signal when the magnet is moving,
    regardless of its absolute position.
2.  The sign of the induced voltage changes depending on the direction
    of motion and orientation of the magnet
3.  The magnitude of the voltage depends on how quickly the magnet is
    moving
4.  All else being equal, the voltage induced in the four coil loop is
    larger than in the two coil loop.

**Lenz's Law**:The direction of the induced current in Faraday's law is
such that its magnetic field opposes the change in flux. That is, nature
does not like changing magnetic fields. This is the reason for the minus
sign in Faraday's law. The following video from the Technical Services
Group at MIT's physics department shows Lenz's law in action.

## The magnetic fields of various current sources

The shape of the magnetic field due to an electric current in a wire
depends on the shape of the wire. The magnetic field of a closed loop
source will be approximately that of a perfect magnetic dipole when
observed far enough from the loop. A good rule of thumb is that we can
use the dipole approximation when the distance from the loop is more
than five times its diameter. Put mathematically, the approximation
holds when *r*  \> \> *a* where *r* is the distance from the observer to
the center of the loop and *a* is the radius of the loop. The magnetic
moment from a loop is *m⃗* = *I**A**n̂*, where *I* is the current in the
loop, *A* is its area, and *n̂* is the unit vector perpendicular to the
plane of the loop. In this course we will consider frequency domain
transmitters. These are transmitters driven by a harmonic current, that
is, a current that varies sinusoidally in time. The magnetic field of a
dipole is given by the magnetization multiplied by a geometric factor,
which implies that the primary magnetic field due to the transmitter
will be harmonic in time:
*H⃗*<sub>*p*</sub> = *H⃗*<sub>0</sub>cos (*ω**t*).

## Everyday examples of EM induction

EM induction is at work in everyday devices as well as in geophysics. A
common example is the metal detector. Figure `metal_detectors` shows
metal detectors at work at airport security and searching for a buried
object.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="./images/metal-detector-example.jpg" id="metal_detectors"
alt="./images/metal-detector-example.jpg" />
<figcaption>: Electromagnetic fields used in metal
detectors.</figcaption>
</figure>

In both cases we see that a current *I*<sub>0</sub> flowing in a
transmitter coil generates a magnetic flux density **B**<sub>0</sub>. As
**B**<sub>0</sub> changes in time, eddy currents are generated in
metallic objects. These eddy currents oscillate in time with the same
periodicity as the transmitter current and generate a secondary magnetic
field **B**′. The primary and secondary fields both pass through the
receiver coil (in the handheld metal detector the transmitter and
receiver coils are concentric) generating a secondary current *I*′ that
can be measured.

## Circuit model for EM induction

Consider the goal of using an inductive EM source to locate a conductive
body buried in a relatively non-conductive (also called resistive) host
material. The basic picture is shown in `3loops_conductor_loop`.

<figcaption>: Conceptual diagram for three loops</figcaption>
</figure>

Eddy currents are generated in the buried body by changing magnetic flux
passing through the body. We can learn a lot about the coupling between
the transmitter, buried body and receiver by approximating the buried
body by a wire coil with resistance *R* and inductance *L*. The
resistance approximates the electrical resistivity of the earth and the
inductance is a geometrical quantity that depends on the shape of the
loop. The following discussion of the circuit model will be mostly
conceptual. For a more detailed and quantitative discussion please see
the
[em.geosci](http://em.geosci.xyz/content/maxwell3_fdem/circuitmodel_for_eminduction/index.html)
resource--(not required for eosc 350.

### Transmitter and primary field

In this course we will consider small loop transmitters with current
varying sinusoidally in time. These are known as harmonic or frequency
domain transmitters. We will only consider transmitters small enough
that the primary magnetic fields they generate are approximately
dipolar, as illustrated in figure `loop_dipole_field` above.
Electromagnetic induction transmitters operate over range of
frequencies---roughly 10<sup>1</sup> Hz - 10<sup>4</sup> Hz. Note that
this is a much lower frequency band than is used in GPR surveys, which
can range from 10<sup>6</sup> Hz - 10<sup>9</sup> Hz.

### Receiver

The receiver is most often also a wire coil The voltage recorded in the
receiver coil will be proportional to the rate of change of magnetic
flux through the loop. One could also measure the magnetic field
directly using a magnetometer but this is not common practice.

### Coupling between transmitter and buried loop

Recall that current is only generated in a loop by the normal component
of the changing magnetic flux passing through it. The magnetic flux is
vector quantity. The closer the direction of the primary magnetic flux
is to the normal of the buried loop, the better the coupling, as
illustrated in figure `coupling_effects` below

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="./images/CouplingEffects.png" id="coupling_effects"
alt="./images/CouplingEffects.png" />
<figcaption>: Couppling effects.</figcaption>
</figure>

The effect on the secondary field of the relative positions and
orientations of the transmitter, receiver, and buried loop can be
summarized by a coupling coefficient, which we will denote *C* . The
ratio of the secondary field to the primary field is the product of
coupling coefficient and an inductive response function *Q* that depends
on the frequency of the transmitter and the resistance and inductance of
the target loop:

$$\frac{H_s}{H_p} = CQ(\alpha) = \frac{\alpha^2 + i\alpha}{1 + \alpha^2}$$

where *α* = *ω**L*/*R* is called the induction number. See
[em.geosci](http://em.geosci.xyz/content/maxwell3_fdem/circuitmodel_for_eminduction/understanding_harmonicEMresponse.html#)
for full derivations of the coupling coefficient and inductive response
function.

The secondary field will have a much smaller amplitude than the primary
field (units of field measurements are often parts per million) and also
a phase shift. We can decompose the signal into a component in phase
with the transmitter and another component one quarter period out of
phase, called the quadrature component. These components can be
represented as a complex number whose real part is the in-phase
secondary field and whose imaginary part is the quadrature signal.

For a given coupling constant, the character of the secondary field can
vary considerably as a function of the induction number *α*, as
illustrated in the following plot

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="./images/induction-response.png"
alt="./images/induction-response.png" />
</figure>

### Measured responses

The basic understanding of the different coupling between the source and
receiver that is due to geometry allows us to sketch the expected
responses that arise from a frequency domain horizontal loop survey
taken over a conductor which is buried in a resistive host. This is a
two-stage process.

1.  Use the geometries of the source and receiver to sketch the
    characteristic curve.
2.  Use the response diagram and the knowledge of whether you are
    dealing with a good conductor or poor conductor to determine the
    relative amplitude of the in-phase and out-of-phase parts.

**Part I:** Consider the basic geometry shown in the figure below

> <figure class="align-center">
> <img src="./images/Coupling_3loops.png"
> alt="./images/Coupling_3loops.png" />
> </figure>

There is a time-varying magnetic field due to the transmitter passing
through the buried loop and hence induced currents in the buried loop.
Those currents generate secondary magnetic fields. The primary field is
shown in grey in the left-hand image and the secondary field due to that
transmitter is shown in red on the right. Note that the primary and
secondary fields point in opposite directions as they pass through the
receiver loop.

We adopt the convention that if the secondary field is in the same
direction as the primary field then the response will be plotted as a
positive value. Alternatively, when the two fields are in opposition the
response will be negative. The distance between the transmitter and
receiver loops is held fixed and the-datum is plotted at the midpoint
between the coils. When both loops are to the left, or to the right, of
the buried loop then the response is positive. The response will be zero
when either coil is over the buried loop. When the receiver, which is a
horizontal coil, is over the loop, then no magnetic flux is passing
through the coil. There will be zero voltage induced. When the
transmitter is directly over the buried loop, there is no flux crossing
the loop, hence no currents will be generated in it and the secondary
magnetic field is zero.

**Part II:** The basic sketch for the shape of the anomalous signal is
determined from the geometry of the coils and the relative locations of
transmitter, receiver and the conductive body. In practice we measure
both an in-phase and an out-of-phase component. Each of these curves
will have the same general shape as the one plotted above. We need only
establish their relative amplitudes. From the general response curve we
find that the in-phase (or real component) is larger than the
out-of-phase (imaginary) component when *ω**σ* (or *ω**L*/*R*) is large.

Below we plot the responses for a survey taken over a buried loop

Because the body is conductive and the frequency of the survey is high,
the value of *ω**L*/*R* is large and the in-phase response is larger
than the quadrature response.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="./images/dipole_response.jpg"
alt="./images/dipole_response.jpg" />
</figure>

## Conductive Host

The sketches regarding EM responses were derived under the simplifying
assumptions that the buried body was in a very resistive medium.
Consequently, the response depended only upon the relative orientations
of the source coil and the body (the coupling effect), the conductivity
of the body and the frequency of the transmitter, and the coupling
effect of the secondary magnetic fields with the receiver.

In more realistic situations the object of interest in buried in a
conductive medium.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="./images/buried_object.jpg"
alt="./images/buried_object.jpg" />
</figure>

The laws of EM induction require that there be eddy currents that are
also set up in the host. But any conductive material in which currents
are flowing is a "lossy" medium. That is, there are *I*<sup>2</sup>*R*
losses which convert the electromagnetic energy to heat. As a
consequence the energy from the source does not propagate to arbitrarily
large depths in the earth. The amplitude of the EM fields thus decrease
due to geometrical spreading and attenuation.

### Primary field in a conductive earth

We have gained insight in the material above by ignoring the background
earth and assuming the EM induction happens only in an isolated target
of interest. In that setting, the primary field propagates through the
background earth as if it was free-space. In reality the earth has some
non-zero electrical conductivity, which will cause it to decay more
quickly than it would in free-space. The strength of the primary field
in the earth will depend upon:

1.  frequency of the transmitter
2.  conductivity of the background material
3.  geometry of the source

Considerable insight can be obtained by ignoring the geometry of the
source and observing how a plane electromagnetic wave decays as it
propagates into the earth. An incoming sinusoidal wave with frequency
*ω* = 2*π**f* travels in the atmosphere at the speed of light
*c* = 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s and has a wavelength *λ* = *c*/*f*. When
the wave enters the conducting earth it still propagates as a sinusoid
but it travels much slower and attenuates rapidly. An example, with
numbers for speed and wavelength is given below.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="./images/EM_diffusion.jpg" alt="./images/EM_diffusion.jpg" />
</figure>

The wave attenuates so fast that it only propagates about a wavelength
into the earth. Because the amplitude diminishes so rapidly and the
waves travel so slowly, we generally talk about the EM wave "diffusing"
into the earth. The amplitude of the field decays exponentially with
depth according to the diagram given below.

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="./images/field_decay.jpg" alt="./images/field_decay.jpg" />
</figure>

$$\begin{aligned}
H  &= H_0 e^\frac{-(1-i)z}{\delta}\\\[0.4em\]
\mid H \mid &= H_0 e^\frac{-z}{\delta}
\end{aligned}$$

**Skin Depth:** This is the depth by which the amplitude has decayed to
1/*e* of its surface value. We have already encountered the concept of
skin depth in the GPR unit. For a uniform halfspace of conductivity *σ*,
and at the low frequencies used in EM induction surveys, the skin depth
*δ* may be approximated as

$$\delta \approx \sqrt{\frac{2}{\mu_0 \omega \sigma} } \approx 500\sqrt{\frac{\rho}{f}}$$

where *ρ* = 1/*σ* is resistivity and *ω*/(2*π*) is frequency.

### At the Buried Body

There is a time varying magnetic field impinging upon the conductor.
This sets up an electric force which causes currents to flow. The
strength of the current is determined by Ohm's law:

*J⃗* = *σ**E⃗*

where *J⃗* is current density in *A*/*m*<sup>2</sup> (amperes per meter
squared) and *E⃗* is the electric field with units of Volts/meter. This
is the version of Ohm's law for extended three-dimensional bodies,
analogous to Ohm's law for circuits: *I* = *V*/*R*, where *R* is the
electrical resistance of the circuit.

The currents in the body produce their own magnetic fields just as in
the case of a loop. These currents will also vary with time and their
magnetic field can be measured at the transmitter. We refer to these
fields as the "secondary" magnetic field, $\vec{H_s}$. Note that the
secondary field may be out of phase with the primary field.

**Summary**

1.  A time varying current in a transmitter produces a time varying
    magnetic field which impinges upon a conductor in the ground.
2.  The changing flux generates and electric field everywhere.
3.  The electric field generates currents via Ohm's Law, *J⃗* = *σ**E⃗* .
4.  The currents produce their own magnetic fields.
5.  The receiver measures the sum of the primary and secondary fields,
    (or it measures associated voltages.)
