EM methods have played an important role in mineral exploration and
engineering problems since at least the early 1960s. A plethora of EM
`systems<electromagnetic_survey>` have been designed over the years,
varying in size, source functions and receiver-transmitter
configurations. The great variety of surveys is reflective of the
scalability EM methods. As illustrated in `EMAllscales`, EM data can be
acquired at the centimeter scale (mine tunnels, structures), to meters
(ground survey) to kilometers (airborne). While the instrumentation may
differ in shape and name, they are all based on the same
`basic principals<electromagnetic_basic_principles>` of EM induction.

The generic electromagnetic (EM) survey is summarized in `3Loops`. The
energy source is either an electric field or changing magnetic field.
The physical property of interests are magnetic permeability, electrical
permitivity and conductivity. The data can also be either electric or
magnetic field values.
