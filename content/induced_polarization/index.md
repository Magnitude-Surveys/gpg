In this section we look at Induced Polarization (IP) surveys. IP surveys
are often linked to DC surveys, and the sources and receivers for IP
surveys are the same. The physical property for IP surveys is
chargeabilityâ€”a measure of how well material holds charge. There are
four types of data that are obtained from these surveys, two in the time
domain and two in the frequency domain. Likewise, there are different
ways to quantify chargeability, so pay close attention to units. We will
also look into the essential equations that go into forward modelling IP
data.
