# Chargeability

Chargeability is a physical property related to conductivity. As we
learned previously, ionic charges within a rock's pore water begin to
move under the influence of an electric field, resulting in electrical
current. However, some of the pore ions do not move uninhibited through
the rock and begin to accumulate at impermeable boundaries. This
build-up of ionic charges is commonly referred to as induced
polarization (IP), as it is responsible for generating electric dipole
moments within the rock. We use chargeability to characterize the
formation and strength of the induced polarization within a rock, under
the influence of an electric field.

The physical explanation for causes of chargeabilty are complex and not
completely understood. Certainly the effects are dependent upon the
microscopic nature the material and specifically upon the surface to
volume ratio of pore material and the types of fluids in the rock. The
two images below offer some insight into the complexity.

Despite the complexity are two primary phenomenological mechanisms which
are insightful in characterizing the chargeable behaviour of rocks:
membrane polarization and electrode polarization.

**Membrane Polarization**

Membrane polarization occurs when the pore space narrows to a within
several ion widths.

Because ionic charges cannot be forced through the pore throat, they
accumulate on either side when an electric field is applied; with
positive charges accumulating on one side of the pore throat and
negative charges accumulating on the other. The accumulation of charges
eventually stops because the electric fields from the blocked charges
becomes large enough that it prevents other ions of the same sign from
joining the group.

The net separation of positive and negative charges across narrow pore
spaces generates a set of electric dipole moments which is ultimately
responsible for the voltages measured in induced polarization survey.

**Electrode Polarization**

Electrode polarization occurs when the pore space is blocked by metallic
particles. When an electric field is applied, the metallic particles
become electrically charged and attract nearby ions.

The attraction of the ions to the surface forms a primary layer of fixed
ionic charges, followed by a secondary diffuse layer of opposing
charges. This is known as an electric double layer.

Each electric double layer results in an electric dipole moment which
contributes towards the induced polarization within the rock.

## Chargeabilities of Common Rocks

Tables (from Telford et al, 1976) provide a very general guide to the
integrated chargeabilities of materials. Because different intervals of
integration $`[t_1,t_2]`$ are used for each table, chargeability values
cannot be compared between tables. However, we can infer several things
from these tables:

- The individual properties of rocks results in a variation in
  chargeability (click `here<table_chargeability_rocks>` for table).
- Chargeability increases as the % abundance of sulphide minerals
  increases (click `here<table_chargeability_sulphide>` for table).
- Highly porous rocks such as extrusive volcanics and sandstones are
  more chargeable than hard rocks such as granites and limestones (click
  `here<table_chargeability_sulphide>` for table).
- The type of ore-mineralization impacts the chargeability of rocks to
  varying degrees (click `here<table_chargeability_minerals>` for
  table).

## Factors Impacting Chargeability

**Sulphide Mineralization:**

As we discussed earlier, electrode polarization occurs when the pore
path is blocked by metallic particles. A major source of these metallic
particles is sulphide mineralization. As the abundance of sulphide
minerals within a rock increases, so does the electrode polarization.
Therefore, highly mineralized rock tend to be very chargeable.

**Clays:**

> <img src="./images/memb_pol_2nd_type.gif"
> alt="./images/memb_pol_2nd_type.gif" />
> </figure>

Clays have a tendancy to partially block the path which ions take
through the rock's pore water. Upon application of an electric
potential, positive charge carriers pass easily, while negative carriers
accumulate. This results in an "ion-selective" membrane polarization.
Clays represent a dominant source of induced polarization in
unmineralized sedimentary rocks.

A surplus of both cations and anions occurs at one end of the membrane,
while a deficiency occurs at the other end. The reduction of mobility is
most obvious at frequencies slower than the diffusion time of ions
between adjacent membrane zones; i.e. slower than around 0.1 Hz.
Conductivity increases at higher frequencies.

**Pore-Water Salinity:**

The induced polarization within a rock depends on having a mechanism for
accumulating ionic charges. It also depends on the salinity of the pore
water; i.e. the concentration of ions within the pore water. As the
pore-water salinity increases, so does the capacity of the rock to
support a build-up of ionic charges. This results in an increases
chargeability for the rock.

**Tortuosity:**

Tortuosity defines the connectivity and complexity of a rock's
pore-space network. As the tortuosity of the rock's pore-space
increases, it becomes more difficult for ionic charges to move through
the rock. As a result, and increases abundance of ionic charges will
accumulate within the rock when it is subjected to an electric field.
Thus, the chargeability of a rock increases and its tortuosity
increases.
