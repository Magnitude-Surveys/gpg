There are apps available as [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks that
accompany the GPG. We recommend using `binder` to access the apps.

## Jupyter Notebooks

Within the Jupyter Notebook environment, you can use `shift + enter` to
run each cell of code, or from the menu, select `cell, run all`

1.  Launch the binder by clicking on the badge above or going to:
    <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/geoscixyz/gpgLabs/main?filepath=notebooks%2Findex.ipynb>
    This can sometimes take a couple minutes, so be patient...
2.  Select the notebook of interest from the contents
3.  `Run the Jupyter notebook <jupyter_notebooks>`
