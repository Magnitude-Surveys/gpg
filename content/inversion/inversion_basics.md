Input: geophysical survey

Output: data

Earth model:

- physical property values, e.g. density, magnetic susceptibility,
  conductivity, elastic properties, etc.
- parameters (e.g. magnetics $`(x,y,z,m,\theta,\rho)`$, $`
  (m,\theta,\gamma)`$ are the strength and orientation of a dipole)

General notation:

``` math
d = F(m)
```

$`d`$: data

$`m`$: model (e.g. $`\rho, \kappa`$)

$`F[]`$: forward modeling operator

e.g. gravity:

``` math
g_z(x,y,z) = -\gamma \int_{vol} \frac{\rho(x',y',z')(z-z')}{( (x-x')^2+(y-y')^2 + (z-z')^2)^{3/2}} dx' dy' dz'
```

To solve this problem numerically we divided the earth into cells, each
with a constant $`\rho`$, and wrote the data as

``` math
g_z(x_i, y_i, z_i) = \sum_{j=1}^M G_{ij} \rho_j \qquad i=1,...,N
```

where

``` math
G_{ij} = - \int_{j^{th} cell} \gamma \frac{(z-z')}{r^3} dv
```

Writing the $`j^{th}`$ datum as $`g_i`$ we have

``` math
g_z(x_i, y_i, z_i): g_i = \sum_{j=1}^M G_{ij} m_j \qquad    i=1,...,N, \quad (1)
```

We also wrote magnetic data in the same way:

``` math
\vec{B}(\rho) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \int_{R} \vec{m}(Q) \cdot \nabla_{\rho} \nabla_{\rho}(\frac{1}{r}) dv
```

after meshing, we wrote:

``` math
b_i = \sum_{j=1}^M G_{ij} \kappa_j \qquad (2)
```

where:

``` math
G_{ij} = \mu_0 \hat{l} \cdot \tau_i^j \cdot \hat{H_0}
```

In both (1) and (2) we can write the relationship between the data and
model as

``` math
&   \vec{d} = G \vec{m} \ \
&   \text{where:} \
&   \vec{d} \in \mathbb{R}^N \qquad (d_1, ..., d_N) \
&   \vec{m} \in \mathbb{R}^M \qquad (m_1, ..., m_M) \
&   G \quad \text{is an} \quad N \times M \quad \text{matrix}
```

In other cases, the general notation $`d=F(m)`$ can t be written as a
simple vector-matrix product. As we shall see in DC resistivity, the
governing equation is:

``` math
\nabla \cdot \sigma \nabla \phi = - I \delta(r-r_s) \qquad (3)
```

where $`\sigma`$ is the electrical conductivity. In the notation
$`d=F[m]`$

- $`d`$: measured voltages
- $`m`$: electrical conductivity
- $`F[]`$: involves the solution of (3) done through finite element or
  finite volume

Lastly, we can have situations where the earth model is a set of
parameters.

<figure class="align-right">

Suppose we wanted to find a best fit dipole that generated surfaces
magnetic response.

``` math
& \vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0 (m)}{4 \pi r^3} (3 (\hat{m} \cdot \hat{r}) \hat{r} - \hat{m}) \ \
& \vec{m} = |m| \hat{m}
```

The parameters are $`(x_0, y_0, z_0, \|m\|, \theta, \gamma)`$ where the
first three define location and the last three are amplitude and
orientation of the dipole. So general representation $`d = F[m]`$, the
model would be the set of parameters.

Remark: The ability to generate data, $`d`$, given a "model" is called
"forward modeling."

## Inverse Problem

Given observed data $`d_i`$ with $`i = 1, ..., N`$ and an estimate of
the data errors, and the forward modeling relationship $`d=F[m]`$ what
is the model $`m`$ that produced the data?

There are two solution strategies with $`N`$ as the number of data and
$`M`$ the number of model parameters.

**Case 1:** when $`N>M`$, that is, when there is more data than
unknowns, (e.g., finding the magnetic dipole parameters) We can post the
inverse problem as one of the finding the best fitting model

**Case 2:** when $`M>N`$, that is, when there are more unknowns than
data, (e.g. 3D inversion of gravity or magnetics). This is a non-unique
problem. We need to incorporate additional information about the model
into the inversion.

Remark: Case 1, finding a few parameters is simpler, so we will deal
with that first.

## Inverse Problem 1: Find a few parameters

Let $`d_i^{obs}`$ from $`i=1,...,N`$ be the observed data.

Let $`\sigma_i`$ be an estimated standard deviation for the ith datum.
Assume that data errors are Gaussian with zero mean and a standard
deviation of $`\sigma_c`$

Define the misfit (this is an appropriate misfit function for Gaussian
statistics):

``` math
\phi_d = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(  \frac{d_i^{obs} - F[m]}{\sigma_i} \right)^2
```

Goal: find the model that minimizes $`\phi_d`$.

Remark: In general, the solution of the problem requires:

1.  A starting model $`\m^{(0)} = (x^{(0)}, y^{(0)}, z^{(0)}, ...)`$
2.  Finding how each datum changes when a parameter changes
    (sensitivity): $`J_{ij} = \partial d_i /  \partial m_j`$
3.  Computing a perturbation
    $`\partial m = (\partial x, \partial y, ...)`$
4.  Forming a new model estimate $`m^{(i)} = m^{(0)} + \partial m`$
5.  Continue steps 2 to 4 until a minimum has been found.

</figure>

Remarks: final results can depend upon the starting model. Consider
minimizing a function of a single variable. In the figure below $`x_2`$
is a better solution.

## Inverse problem II: finding a function

Consider the simple case where we write:

``` math
d = Gm
```

with $`G`$ as an $`N \times M`$ matrix. There are infinitely many
solutions. For example, consider the case where there are two unknowns
$`m_1`$ and $`m_2`$ and one datum:

<figure class="align-right">
<img src="./images/line.jpg" alt="./images/line.jpg" />
</figure>

``` math
m_1 + m_2 = 1
```

and the solution is

``` math
m_2 = 1 - m_1
```

Any point along the line is a viable solution. To find a particular
solution we need to have additional information (a priori knowledge)
about the solution. For example, suppose we knew that the earth model
was one where $`\||m\||^2`$ was small. Then let

``` math
\phi_m = \||m\||^2 = \sum m_i^2
```

For our toy example this gives $`\phi_m = m_1^2 + m_2^2`$. Question:
what is the $`m`$ that minimize $`\phi_m`$ and still fits the data
constraint?

<figure class="align-right">
<img src="./images/toy_solution.jpg" alt="./images/toy_solution.jpg" />
</figure>

``` math
& \text{min } \phi_m = m_1^2 + m_2^2 \
& \text{subject to } m_1 + m_2 = 1
```

The answer is $`m = (m_1, m_2) = (1/\sqrt{2},1/\sqrt{2} )`$

So this is a way to get a single solution that also includes additional
information about the earth model.

For a general problem in 3D, we introduce a model objective function

``` math
\phi_m = \alpha_s \int_{vol} (m-m_{ref})^2 dv + \alpha_x \int_{vol} \left(\frac{dm}{dx} \right)^2 dv + \alpha_y \int_{vol} \left(\frac{dm}{dy} \right)^2 dv + \alpha_z \int_{vol} \left(\frac{dm}{dz} \right)^2 dv
```

The first term makes a solution close to a reference model (which can be
zero); the second term minimizes structure in the x-direction, the third
term in the y-direction, and the fourth term in the z-direction. The
parameters $`\alpha_s, \alpha_x, \alpha_y, \alpha_z`$ are constants that
control the relative wighting of the different penalty terms.

Again, to solve the problem numerically we need to divide the earth into
cells (as done in the forward modeling)

``` math
\phi_m & = \alpha_s \|W_s (m-m_{ref}) \|^2 + \alpha_x \|W_x (m-m_{ref}) \|^2  + \alpha_y \|W_y (m-m_{ref}) \|^2 +\alpha_z \|W_z (m-m_{ref}) \|^2  \
& = (m-m_{ref}) \left( \alpha_s W_s^T W_s  + x W_x^T W_x \alpha_y W_y^T W_y + \alpha_z W_z^T W_z \right) (m-m_{ref}) \
\phi_m & = \|W_m(m-m_{ref})\|^2
```

where $`W_m`$ is an $`M \times M`$ matrix ($`W_s, W_x, W_y,W_z`$ are
alos matrices).

So our prior knowledge about what kind of solution we want is encoded
into $`\phi_m`$. This is extremely important. If we followed the ideas
in the toy example we would be led to formulate our problem as

``` math
\begin{aligned}
& \text{minimize } \phi_m \|W_m(m-m_{ref})\|^2 \\[0.4em]
& \text{subject to } d^{obs} = F[m]
\end{aligned}
```

But the observation $`d^{obs}`$ have errors. We don't want to find a
solution that fits the inaccurate data exactly (then we would be
guaranteed to have the wrong model). Rather, we define the misfit as

``` math
\phi_d = \sum \left( \frac{d_i^{obs} - F[m]}{\sigma_i}\right)^2
```

If the data are contaminated with Gaussian error then, if are at the
solution $`m`$,

<figure class="align-right">
<img src="./images/obs_pred.jpg" alt="./images/obs_pred.jpg" />
</figure>

Solve the inverse problem by

``` math
\text{minimize } \phi = \phi_d + \beta \phi_m
```

where $`\beta \in [0,\infty)`$ is a regularization parameter. As
$`\beta`$ changes from zero to infinity

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="./images/phi_d_phi_m.jpg" alt="./images/phi_d_phi_m.jpg" />
</figure>

As $`\beta \rightarrow 0`$, min $`\phi = \phi_d \rightarrow`$ small
misfit ($`\phi_d`$), large model norm ($`\phi_m`$).

As $`\beta \rightarrow \infty`$, min $`\phi = \phi_m \rightarrow`$ small
model norm ($`\phi_m=0`$), large misfit ($`\phi_d`$).

Putting these together yields the Tikhonov curve

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="./images/tikhonov.jpg" alt="./images/tikhonov.jpg" />
</figure>

When we minimize $`\phi = \phi_d + \beta \phi_m`$ every value of
$`\beta`$ gives a difference solution. We can experiment and find that
value of $`\beta`$ for which the misfit is equal to some desired target
level $`\phi_d^*`$.
