# Processing

This section focusses on the the temporal and spatial correction of
magnetic data prior to the interpretation phase. In most cases, these
processing steps are completed by the acquisition team, providing both
the raw and processed data as a final product.

## Removal of time variations

Earth's magnetic field changes over time for a variety of
`reasons<magnetics_external_sources>`. If the changes in earth's field
have an amplitude that is significant compared to our anomalous signal,
then we need to correct for the observed temporal variations. The
general procedure is to establish a
`base-station<magnetics_base_station>` which is fixed in location and
continually measures the magnetic field. Each datum acquired by the
roving sensor is also time-stamped. The assumption is then made that the
changes in the Earth's magnetic field caused by these natural sources
have a long enough spatial wavelength that they are same at any point on
the survey grid. Field data, corrected for these time variations, is
obtained through the following subtraction process

*Δ***B**(*t*) = **B**<sub>*o**b**s*</sub>(*t*) − **B**<sub>*b**a**s**e*</sub>(*t*)

The Geological Survey of Canada
[geomag](http://www.geomag.nrcan.gc.ca/index-eng.php) page can provide
graphs of diurnal variations observed at any of 11 magnetic
observatories in Canada, for any day in the most recent 3 years.

## Removal of regional trends

In order to interpret magnetic data in terms of features and structures
at depth, the anomalous field caused by buried features of interest must
be isolated. In other words, we must try to remove the contribution to
the measurements made by the earth's field and also from geologic
features larger than the actual survey area. That is, we want to remove
a regional field. If we designate magnetic fields as **B**, then we want
to perform the following

**B**<sub>*a*</sub> = *Δ***B** − **B**<sub>*r**e**g**i**o**n**a**l*</sub>

Estimates of the regional field may be obtained using:

-   the `IGRF<magnetics_IGRF>`
-   a constant value selected by the interpreter (when survey areas are
    small);
-   a more sophisticated polynomial (map) generated by a computer using
    least squares (or other) analysis of data;
-   it is also possible to use inversion at a large scale to define a
    regional field.

To illustrate the process, when data are collected along a line, the
removal of a regional trend can be managed graphically, as shown here:

<figure class="align-center">

</figure>

Clearly this process involves some degree of subjectivity and will
depend upon how you draw a line that separates the desired "signal" from
the background. The situation becomes more complicated for magnetic maps
(data collected over an area) where the causative bodies have
complicated shapes and variable dimensions. Nevertheless, removing an
approximate regional field can be of critical importance in isolating an
anomaly for further processing as maps or input into an inversion. The
following is an example showing the regional magnetic map and a local
anomalous field taken from a survey in central British Columbia. The
area is Mt. Milligan, which has recently opened up as a mine. In the
large-scale map the dominant feature is the magnetic signature of the
mountain. Of interest is a (2km x 2km) segment of that map. A
large-scale regional field is estimated, subtracted from the observed
data, and the results are shown in a second window. The magnetic feature
observed in that map is related to the ore body.

## Reduction to Pole

Reduction to pole is a processing step which allows for easier
interpretation of magnetic data. During a reduction to pole, the
observed data are used to compute the magnetic anomaly that would have
been measured if the Earth's field had been vertical (90
  <sup>*o*</sup> inclination).

The magnetic anomalies from susceptible bodies depend significantly on
the inclination and declination of the Earth's magnetic field; see
`fig_reduce_to_pole_1`. As a result, it may be challenging to resolve
the location/orientation of a susceptible body solely by examining the
anomaly it produces. In `fig_reduce_to_pole_1` b, we see that the
location of maximum anomaly amplitude is offset from the location of the
steel pipe. However, the location of the pipe and the maximum anomaly
amplitude are the same when the inclination is 90   <sup>*o*</sup>; this
is the case for most susceptible bodies. For an inclination of 90
  <sup>*o*</sup>, it is also easier to determine if the object is
elongated or dipping.

</figure>

To demonstrate the effectiveness of reduction to pole, let us consider a
magnetic UXO survey (`fig_reduce_to_pole_2`). On the left, we see the
total magnetic field data collected at the survey site. Although
anomalies indicate the presence of a number of potential targets, the
location of each object relative to the anomaly it produces is
inconsistent. However after completing a reduction to pole (right), the
location of each potential targets becomes easily visible.
