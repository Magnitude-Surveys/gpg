Measurements of the magnetic field contain information about subsurface
variations in **magnetic susceptibility**. Data can be acquired in the
air (planes, satellites), on the ground (stationary, moving platforms,
marine) and underground (boreholes, tunnels). The measurements record
the sum of Earth's field and fields induced in magnetic materials. More
magnetic (i.e. susceptible) materials have stronger induced fields.
Removing Earth's field from the observations yields anomalous fields
that can be interpreted in terms of where magnetic material lies and
also its susceptiblity and shape. Processed data are presented as maps
or profiles, and advanced processing, involving inversion, yields
parametric structures or 3D models of the subsurface susceptibility
distribution. Magnetic surveying is extremely versatile and can be
applied in many areas in the geosciences including geologic mapping,
mineral exploration, unexploded ordnance detection, and archeology.
