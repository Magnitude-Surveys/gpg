# Vertical Resolution

The vertical resolution of a seismic data sets describes how thin a
layer can be before the reflections from its top and its bottom become
indistinguishable. This depends upon the shape of the seismic source
wavelet. The shape, or more particularly the signal wavelength depends
upon the frequency and the velocity of the materials. Recall that
$`\lambda = vt`$.

Vertical resolution is defined in a visual sense: that is, "can the two
arrivals echoing off the top of the layer and the bottom of the layer be
distinguished"? In the case to the right there will be no trouble seeing
both returning wavelets because the time signals spent in layer 2 is
such that the two pulses are far enough apart to be distinguished.

In the second case the two pulses overlap so the interpretation is of
one layer only. Recall that we are depicting ideal situations with these
figures. What is a minimum thickness for layer 2 before the two pulses
overlap? Intuitively the two pulses will overlap unless the distance
within the layer is more than a wavelength. Since the second pulse
travels both directions this means that when layer 2 is 1/2 wavelength
thick, the two pulses will arrive well separated.

In fact, the theoretical minimum thickness is 1/4 wavelength. In other
words, careful processing can extract the pulses if they overlap by half
a wavelength, but this theoretical minimum is never really achieved in
practice.

How does this thickness in terms of wavelength translate into real
distances? As noted above, wavelength depends upon frequency of the
signal and on velocity of the medium. Therefore the vertical resolution
of a survey depends upon both the signals used and the materials
themselves. The following image with its table of velocities and
frequencies illustrates.
