# Reflection

In reflection seismology we record seismic pulses that are reflected
from boundaries which separate layers that have different acoustic
impedances. Unlike in refraction surveying, information in the
seismogram which comes after the first arrival is important. In general
the processing is considerably different than in refraction surveying.

In reflection seismology, seismic records from many sets of shots and
receivers are used to generate a Normal Incidence Reflection Seismogram
which has reflections that correspond to a vertically traveling wave.
The reflections occur at travel times that are determined by the
velocity and the length of the travel path in each layer. The normal
incidence reflection seismograms are acquired at regular distances along
the surface and are composited into a seismic section. This generates an
image of the substructure that can be used in an identical manner to a
radar section.

In order to benefit from gathering several echoes from each reflecting
point there are numerous operations that need to be applied to the data.
Much of the data processing is tied to the hypothesis that the earth's
properties vary most strongly in the vertical direction. The following
points illustrate the fundamental procedural concept underlying the
creation of a final seismic reflection section:
